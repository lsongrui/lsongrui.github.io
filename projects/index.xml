👨‍🏫 Academically supervised by Prof. Zhe JI
Lead developer of team of 4, in charge of algorithm incorporation and code structure design
DualSPHysics, CUDA, C++
Abstract Through the introduction of new numerical models, the simulation capability of the original open-source Smoothing Length Hydrodynamic software DualSPHysics can be extended to more accurately capture the movement of water affected by factors such as air, material properties of the body surface, and its own material properties, then effectively predict the trajectory of water after rainfall.</description>

      <description>Imperial College London MS.c Individual Project *
📍Imperial College London 🇬🇧 📅 05/2020-10/2020 👨‍🏫supervised by Prof. Yongyun Hwang and Dr. Lloyd Fung Individual MATLAB Abstract The term &amp;ldquo;Gyrotactic&amp;rdquo; represents the swimming behaviour of certain types of microorganisms in suspension subjected to gravity and shear torque. The interesting collective behaviour is shown in the vertical pipe flow, that is, the cells swim toward the centre and the wall in the downward flow and the upward flow, respectively.</description>

👨‍🏫supervised by Prof. Eusebio Valero Sanchez &amp;amp; Prof. Yaguo Lyu
Individual
DLR-TAU
Abstract This paper combines the Rans equation solver TAU and the BiGloble stability analysis theory to analyze the flow instability and extract the main model of it.
Firstly, a validation case of cylinder flow at Re = 60 is simulated and the results of the Strouhal number match the experience data.</description>
